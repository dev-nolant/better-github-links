## What is BGL (Better GitHub Links)?
BGL (Better GitHub Links) is a new way of providing links for your MarkDown files in GitHub. GitHub doesn't automatically allow the '\_blank' tab to be implimented, so any time you click a link, the current page is replaced. 

This can lead to a lack of user interaction on your GitHub pages. BGL fixes this by being the middle man in the proccess.

_Currently in development_ ~ The current state requires the user to press a button if the page doesn't automatically load. It works either way, but it is more of a hastle sadly. We plan on fixing this as soon as we can, but in the meantime, it's still a good solution!
